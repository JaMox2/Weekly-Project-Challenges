# Weekly-Project-Challenges
Weekly Challenges that allow me to build a better foundation on my programming logic and along with my understanding on HTML, Css, and JS. I created an idea Generator that spits out a weekly project from a list of inputed projects that is stored in the local storage, which allows me to add and change my list without it having to reset everytime i load it.
