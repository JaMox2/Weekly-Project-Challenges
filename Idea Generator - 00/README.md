# Idea Generator Project 01
I wanted to do weekly projects that would allow me to build my programming logic and along with my understanding on HTML, Css, and JS. But I found it annoying to have to search for projects every week so in turn I created a way to list a bunch of project ideas that would stay on my localStorage. And than all I need to do is click generate which will spit out a project.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I first needed to have a list that would stay on my localStorage so I wouldn't have to redo the list everytime. I than created functions that would grab from that list. I made a number generator from 0 to the length of the list so i can get a random number which in turn will spit out an idea from the list[with the index of the random number]

## Optimizations

There is a lot of other features I can add for this to make it even better such as animations for the generator so it doesn't just spit out projects looking to plain. I also want to add a function that will remove the idea from the list once I have told it that I have done that project.

## Lessons Learned:

With this simple project I learned how to change an array to a JSON string which will allow it to be stored in a single localStorage value. Along with that I learned how to be able to change it back to a normal array andd access it like a noraml array and not a JSON string
