# Number Validation 02
Using the idea generator that I mad I was given the challenge to make a Number Validation. With this I decided to just make a simple form so I could practice making things responsive so that it would fit with all media size. A form that will only submit if the number is the right pattern.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I made a simpel Sign-in form using html and css, I wanted to practice makeing a responsive form so I made it so that it would fit mobile as well. After making the form I used Regex to set a pattern so it would only accept phone numbers(from the US) While working with event listener 'input'.

## Optimizations

I want to add this for more of my projects. I also should be able to add a password pattern constriction and in other forms that may need a certain pattern for inputs using RegEx.

## Lessons Learned:

With this project I was able to work with forms and allowed me to add a phone number validation. I had to work with regular expression to be able to set a pattern for e number input.
